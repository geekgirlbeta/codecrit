                <h1>Code Crit</h1>
<p>There are four elements to the Code Crit methodology.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules</li>
<li>Pre-Review</li>
<li>Code Critique</li>
<li>Constructive Criticism</li>
</ul>
<h1>Rules</h1>
<p>Before we even start the process we have to institute rules. By instituting 
rules we avoid chaos. These rules are the same as the ones followed in an art 
class while preforming art critiques. Organizations can add to these rules, but 
should avoid removing the base set.</p>
<h3>Respect</h3>
<p>This encompasses not just a level of respect for your coworkers, but for yourself, 
your company, your project, the community etc. </p>
<p>This also means respect the process. This is not the time to express personal 
issues you have with coworkers. </p>
<p>This is about the code. Period.</p>
<h3>Be prepared</h3>
<p>The programmer and the code should be ready for critique. </p>
<p>It is disrespectful to enter a code crit when the programmer and/or the code are 
not ready for critique.</p>
<h3>Neutral Language</h3>
<p>One must stay neutral where being neutral is required. Speaking in neutral terms 
keeps the dialog open. Nothing kills a conversation faster than negativity. 
Perceived or other wise.</p>
<h3>Constructive Criticism</h3>
<p>Put somehting here. Elaborated on below.</p>
<h3>Stay Focused</h3>
<p>The purpose of the code critique is to ensure the code being released works. 
This is not the time to engineer massive changes or talk about other features 
that do not effect this code.</p>
<h3>Mandatory participation</h3>
<p>This was one of the more important rules pertaining to art critiques. Mandatory 
participation ensures the code is reviewed, that it is understood, and there is 
another level of responsibility for the release.</p>
<h1>Pre Code Review</h1>
<ul>
<li>Identify your work.</li>
<li>Run ALL relevant testing.</li>
<li>Know your code!</li>
<li>Check that the code meets all requirements.</li>
<li>Do not waste the time of others with unprepared code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The person submitting code to be reviewed has a responsibility. If they don’t 
complete their part of this process, the rest isn’t going to work. </p>
<p>Think of the Pre Code Review as a set of good habits you should cultivate.</p>
<p>An organization can add to this list, but shouldn't take any of these steps away. 
At the end of the day, a developer who doesn’t preform these requirements going 
into the code review isn’t respecting the process. </p>
<p>Bottom line: <strong>code needs to be ready to be reviewed.</strong></p>
<h1>Code Crit Stages</h1>
<ol>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Analysis</li>
<li>Interpretation</li>
<li>Judgement</li>
</ol>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Description stage is where the work is identified, and an inventory is made 
using neutral terms. (We are not fixing problems at this point, just adding them 
to the inventory, described below.)</p>
<p>Aside from assembling a through inventory of the code, the description stage 
serves an important purpose for the reviewer. This is where a consensus is 
reached within the team. </p>
<p>By compliling an inventory we avoid conflict and confusion. This inventory keeps 
all persons focused on the same parts of the code. By staying neutral and focused 
we avoid wasting time by not getting caught up in conflict or misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Staying neutral in the description stage is vital. If the programmer submitting 
the code has followed the rules, and their pre code review steps, it will mean 
the code is working. </p>
<p>If the code doesn’t work, we shouldn’t be reviewing it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When reviewing code an expert should be involved. A person shouldn’t be the 
sole reviewer if they are not experienced with the language. Example: A programmer 
who only knows C, should not be the sole reviewer for a Python project. The 
more you know about the language, the better you will be able to critique the 
code written in it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is an Inventory?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Inventory is a list of what is in the code. The purpose is to make the 
reviewer slow down and see what is there. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>The Analysis stage is where we will go beyond the inventory we have taken in the 
Description. We start to talk about the relationships of the code. How it works 
on it’s own, and how it will work with other code. </p>
<p>A complete examination can now be made of the code. Using the inventory, observations 
can be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the code function well? </li>
<li>Will the code work with existing code?</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of the examination will be a through understanding of the code, which means <em>no surprises</em>. </p>
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>Description  +  Analysis  =  Interpretation</p>
<p>Interpretation stage is where we ask what our earlier observations mean? </p>
<p>Suggestions can be made, in a constructive manner, as to any changes that can or 
should be made to the code. </p>
<p>This stage is where an opportunity arises that is often missed. It is a chance to 
make ourselves better developers, better leaders, and use mentorship to benefit 
the company and community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a person walks away from a code review feeling emotionally and verbally beaten 
they lose their love of programming. Disgruntled, low morale employees are not going 
to produce quality code. They are going to be looking for other jobs. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Judgement</h3>
<p>Can the code ship?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes? <strong>Ship it.</strong></li>
<li>No? <strong>Fix it.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes will need to be reviewed. It won’t take as long as we are just reviewing 
the fix. This next pass can be treated as a second set of eyes as long as we 
have reached a consensus from the previous review. </p>
<h1>Constructive Criticism</h1>
<p>In theory constructive criticism is an easy concept to grasp. Putting it into 
practice is much more difficult. </p>
<p>Constructive criticism is an art form in and of itself. One has to master not 
only being able to give, but being able to recieve. As a recipiant people will 
often have to be able to listen and understand they will not always like what 
they hear.</p>
<p>Information needs to be communicated clearly and without the use of compliment 
sandwiches. The goal is to actually give valuable feedback that will contribute 
to improved code and knowledgable programmers.</p>
<p>Building enjoyable and open lines of communication. Together we should want to 
help others grow and improve.</p>
<p>Communication and constructive criticism are what makes the whole process work. </p>
