    <p>Code reviews don’t have to be a time consuming, morale zapping, arduous tasks.
Not only can they catch bugs and errors but they can contribute in positive ways
to the individual developer, the team, management and company as a whole.</p>
<p>Art critiques have existed in academia for hundreds of years.
The methodology of the critique has evolved to be time sensitive and productive,
while keeping the enthusiasm of the student artist intact.</p>
<p>The purpose of the art critique is to get peers and mentors to look at the work
and raise any problems they may see. It’s also time where people with more
experience could contribute their knowledge in a helpful way. This process is
about producing the best work, quickly and in a productive and constructive way.</p>
<p>These methods can be applied to code review. </p>
