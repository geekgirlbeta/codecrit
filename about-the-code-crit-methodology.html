            <p>The Code Crit Methodology was born out of observations made by an artist turned programmer.</p>
            <p>This artist viewed writing code as an artistic endeavor. It required creative problem solving as well as a mastery
                of the chosen medium.</p>
            <p>Programming was appealing because of the similarities between creating art and writing code. These included more
                than just problem solving and mastery of mediums. Art, specifically photography, is a very process driven
                expression form. It requires a high technical knowledge of math and chemistry. Beyond mathematical and chemical
                both mediums use testing and a review process.</p>
            <p>This review process, often referred to as the code review, sounded much like the art critique used in college.</p>
            <p>Discussions with web engineers and articles on blogs revealed a dislike for the code review process. </p>
            <p>Combining the purpose of the code review and the principles of the art crit a methodology was conceived. </p>
